/*  Getting_BPM_to_Monitor prints the BPM to the Serial Monitor, using the least lines of code and PulseSensor Library.

--------Use This Sketch To------------------------------------------
1) Displays user's live and changing BPM, Beats Per Minute, in Arduino's native Serial Monitor.
2) Print: "â™¥  A HeartBeat Happened !" when a beat is detected, live.
2) Learn about using a PulseSensor Library "Object".
4) Blinks LED on PIN 13 with user's Heartbeat.
